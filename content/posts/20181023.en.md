Abandoning the Thought of Awakening through Dread of the Faults of Cyclic Existence













  我们已经学习了退失愿菩提心的前两个原因。退失愿菩提心的第三个原因就是：

  因畏惧轮回过患而退失愿菩提心。

  看到了生老病死之苦、且会为一些忘恩负义之人以怨报德，你可能会觉得在轮回中这样多劫累世下去真的毫无意义和希望，故而想放弃为度化一切众生而成佛的决心。

​    在《牟尼密意显明论》中，萨迦班智达教导说，有一些对治此种畏惧轮回过患的方法：



1、如果你明白构成一个众生身心的一切只不过是一些垢染的蕴聚（入或蕴：色、受、想、行、识五蕴），如同幻化，你就可以去除这种畏惧；

2、如父母对独子的爱护不舍，对众生也培养起这种爱心；

3、能够生起视多劫累世与刹那瞬间无二无别、视三时（过去、现在、未来）也无二无别的明慧。

  还有，你也可以通过观修祈请上师和护法、回向自己所有的善根，以此来避免退失自己的愿菩提心。

  这方面有一个非常好的公案来自著名的陈那大师。有次当他想放弃愿菩提心的时候，他的护法神文殊师利菩萨制止了他。

  当时陈那论师正在一个山洞中修行，同时也在研读佛经。他觉得佛的教法散布在太多的经书当中了，于是他想以一本简明而又全面的书来将佛的教法汇集起来。为此想法所鼓舞，他在山洞的墙上写了一首偈子，在礼赞佛的同时也表明了自己想写这本书的目的。此时，很多吉祥的征兆显现出来：大地为之动摇，光明也布满了整个山洞。

  这时，一个印度教外道也见证了这些吉祥的征兆，并为之满怀疑虑。以他的神通力，他能够看到陈那论师的著作将会在后世危及印度教的传承。所以当陈那论师离开山洞去行乞之时，那个印度教外道就潜入了陈那论师的山洞，并将陈那论师在山洞墙壁上写的字迹擦得一干二净。看到自己的作品被擦掉了，陈那论师就再写上去，然后当他离开后又被擦掉，如此再次三番。这样三天过去之后，第四天陈那论师又写了一首偈子，并在偈子的最后邀请那位擦掉他作品的人现身来当面辩论。

  这次，那位印度教外道看到这一信息后，就留在了山洞里等待陈那论师归来。陈那论师回来后，两人就何谓胜义谛发生了极为激烈的辩论。陈那论师赢得了这场辩论，并坚持要求那位印度教外道改宗佛教。那位外道的反应就是以其神通力一把火烧向了陈那论师。火势之大足以烧毁山洞旁边的树木，但仅只是烧焦了陈那论师的头发和胡须而已，就是因为陈那论师有愿菩提心的力量。那位印度教外道见势不妙，就以其神通力逃之夭夭并消失在天空中。









  陈那论师为此非常气馁，他想：只是一个外道就惹出了这么多的麻烦，要是多几个的话，那我的为度化一切众生而成佛之路将会有多少障碍啊？那真是毫无意义！

  绝望中他把自己想放弃菩提心的想法写在了一根木条上，并将木条抛向了天空。他决定木条落地之时即是他放弃菩提心之时，再也不愿去帮助其他众生了。

  在等待木条落地的时候，他望向天空，发现那根木条握在了文殊师利菩萨的手中。当文殊师利菩萨知道陈那论师已经畏惧到了要放弃菩提道修行这一地步时，就劝勉他不要放弃，文殊师利菩萨会一直作为他的精神导师直至他能够证悟初地（欢喜地）或进入佛国。文殊师利菩萨还鼓励他继续完成自己的著作。

  在他的护法神文殊师利菩萨的加持下，陈那论师最终完成了他的著作并成为了一个伟大的学者。他的著作开创了佛教逻辑与认识论（量学）的思想体系，并为之奠定了坚实的基础。他以印度佛教逻辑的奠基者而名闻后世。







  对于所有的修行人来说，陈那论师的这一轶事都是坚持到底才会胜利的鼓舞人心的范例。作为修行人，在菩提之路上总会遇到这样那样的障碍，最重要的是要记住：坚持不懈地将我们的心意识朝觉醒的愿菩提心方向转化，这才是真正的成佛之道。成佛之后你就会有无量的方便法门去利益无边的众生。你证悟了，就能引导无量的众生并激励他们也去证悟。

  牢记退失愿菩提心的三大原因，能够提醒我们时时留意这些可能阻碍我们生起愿菩提心的因素。如果你注意到这些修行路上的陷阱，你就能知道自己应该留意有哪些可能的陷阱，以及如何去避免或对治它们。

Abandoning the Thought of Awakening through Dread of the Faults of Cyclic Existence



  Previously, we learnt about the first and second causes of abandoning the thought of awakening.  Of the three causes of abandoning the thought of awakening or generating Bodhicitta, the third cause is:

  Abandoning the thought of awakening through dread of the faults of cyclic existence:

Seeing the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness and death and upon being mistreated by people to whom you have been kind, you might consider abandoning the thought of attaining awakening for the sake of all sentient beings discouraged by the hopelessness of remaining in cyclic existence for many eons.

  In his work “Clarifying the Sage’s Intent”, Sakya Pandita says that there are remedies to this dread of the hopelessness of cyclic existence.  

  You can remove such fears by understanding that these defiling personal aggregates (skandha: the five aggregates {form, feelings, perception, compositional factors and consciousness} that constitute a sentient beings mental and physical being are like an illusion; by cultivating the attitude of love towards sentient beings that a parent has towards an only son; and by the discerning wisdom that perceives no difference between an eon and an instant and realize that the three times – past, present and future are without time.













  Also, you will be able to avoid such thoughts of abandoning the thought of awakening by meditating on the religious preceptor and the tutelary deities and by means of prayers dedicating the roots of virtue. 

   An example of this occurred in the life of the great master Dignaga.  When he was about to abandon the thought of awakening, he was prevented from doing so by his tutelary deity Arya Manjushri.

  When Dignaga was meditating in a cave and studying Buddha’s scriptures, he felt that the Buddha’s teachings were scattered in too many scriptures.  He wanted to make a concise and complete book of the Buddha’s teachings. Feeling very inspired, he wrote one verse in praise of the Buddha as well as stated his purpose in writing this book on the walls of the cave.  All at once, many auspicious signs were displayed.  The earth shook and lights surrounded the cave.  

  At that very moment, a Hindu scholar witnessed these very auspicious signs and became very suspicious.  Through his mystical powers, he was able to see that Dignaga’s work could hinder the Hindu tradition.  So when Dignaga left the cave to beg for alms, the Hindu scholar crept into the cave and erased Dignaga’s writings on the cave walls.  On finding his work erased, Dignaga wrote again and again it was wiped off when he left the cave.  This continued for three days.  On the fourth day, Dignaga wrote a verse and at the end of it, he invited the person erasing it to meet him in person.  

  The Hindu scholar saw the message and waited for Dignaga. When Dignaga returned, they had a fierce debate on the proper view of Ultimate Reality.  Dignaga won this debate and he insisted that the Hindu scholar should give up his practice and become a Buddhist.  In response the Hindu scholar using his magical powers spat fire at Dignaga.  The fire was powerful enough to burn the trees around the cave but it could only burn Dignaga’s hair and beard because of the power of his awakening Bodhicitta.  The Hindu scholar flew and disappeared into the sky. 



  Feeling discouraged, Dignaga thought that if even one heretic could cause so much trouble and if they were many of them, then his own path to gaining Buddhahood for all sentient beings would be full of obstacles and pointless. 

  In despair he wrote his intentions to give up the thought of enlightenment on a piece of wood and flung it into the sky.  He decided that from the moment the wood falls back, he would give up his quest for enlightenment and never strive to help other sentient beings. 

  As he waited for the piece of wood to fall, Dignaga looked up into the sky and he saw Manjushri holding the piece of wood in his hands.  When Manjushri learnt that Dignaga was feeling discouraged to the point of giving up his practice, Manjushri advised him not to give up and that Manjushri himself would be his spiritual guide until Dignaga attained the first bhumi or Buddha field.  Manjushri also encouraged Dignaga to continue his writing. 

  With the blessings of Manjushri, his tutelary deity, Dignaga continued his work and went on to become a great scholar.  His work laid the foundations and created the first system of Buddhist logic and epistemology (pramana).  He became known as the one of the Buddhist founders of Indian logic.





 

  This story of Dignaga is an encouraging example of perseverance for all practitioners.  As practitioners we will all face some form of obstacle or other in our path but the important thing to remember is to continue in our resolve to turn our minds towards awakening Bodhicitta which is the path to attaining Buddhahood.  By attaining Buddhahood you can perform vast activities to benefit infinite sentient beings.  If you attain enlightenment, you can guide immeasurable sentient beings and in turn motivate them to awaken the enlightened mind.  

  By reminding ourselves of the three causes of abandoning the thought of awakening Bodhicitta, it will help to look out for these factors that will cause obstacles in our path to generating Bodhicitta.  If you are aware of the pitfalls in your practice, then you will know what to look out for, and how to avoid or overcome such pitfalls.
