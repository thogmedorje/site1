A Discourse on "Clarifying the Sage's Intent" with His Eminence Khondung Asanga Vajra Sakya Rinpoche.

At the humble request of his students, His Eminence Khondung Asanga Vajra Sakya Rinpoche has kindly agreed to give a discourse on "Clarifying the Stage's Intent" in a series of talks and conversations on a biweekly rotation Zoom gathering starting on September 12th 2020.

Sakya Pandita's " Clarifying the Sage's Intent" describes the stages of a Bodhisattva's path and is therefore an excellent teaching for Dharma practitioners who are new or in the beginning stages. These profound teachings are also great for all levels of practitioners in focusing on the foundations of their practice and understanding of the Buddha Dharma.

Rinpoche will commence the Zoom gathering by giving an oral transmission and instructions on " Gangloma" (Praise to Manjushri), Buddha of Wisdom as it is appropriate to start the educational series by invoking the name of Arya Manjushri.
Interested students are welcome to join in these Zoom gatherings starting September 12th, 2020 from 7:00 am - 9:00 am ( Pacific Daylight Time).

These teachings will be in English and Chinese translation will be provided.
