## **Supplication to Maňjuśrī - Known as “Praising as Cognizable Space”**

By Indian Mahāpandita Vidya Kokila



Having realized the cognizable, which is profound and vast like space, you attained the sun Mandala like wisdom of the enlightened one, and with a voice like light rays, all the ignorance of all sentient beings, which is like darkness, you O Maňjuśrī are the supreme dispeller. To you I pay respect!



From this time onward, for all lifetimes, I have no refuge other than you.Therefore, due to my karma, wherever in the six classes of beings I am born,

I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to save me from the fears of samsāra!



I, when letting go of this life, will have to let go of all of the ones compassionate to me (parents and relatives), and ones loving to me (friends),and when the

fierceness and terrifying *Yama* (Lord of death) ends me, 

I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to save me from the fear of *Yama!*



Due to the power of accumulating nonvirtues from beginning less time, there is a possibility, that when I roam the intermediate state, the powerful wind of defilements

will deliver me to the cliff of evil places of unbearable difficulties. 

Therefore,I implore you, O *Manjusri*, to shut the door of the defilement gale!



When the time comes, for my consciousness of the intermediate state to reincarnate, may I utterly transcend the eight nonfreedoms (of practicing theDharma), 

and I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to establish the interdependent

connection for me being born perfectly into the class of upholders of the victorybanner of the *Muni* (Able Sage)!



In my future lives may I be endowed with the qualities of the higher states (Devas and Humans), a body with the freedoms and favorable attributes which is beautified with the supreme seven treasures.  Having attained such a body,

I implore you, O *Manjusri*, to establish the interdependent connection for me to meet teachers, who uphold the doctrine in the right manner!



May I, properly comprehend, the eloquent ocean of excellent sayings taught by the teacher that I meet, who is skilled in means, and compassionate, and once comprehended,

 I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to grant me the discernment and Intelligence to be able to show it to others!



Throughout all my lifetimes, for only the sake of others, 

I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī ,*to grant me the ability to give all possessions without stinginess, to be able to practice meditation without distraction, and to be endowed with the Six Perfections!



The supreme cooler of the painful heat of samsara, is the snow mountain of excellent sayings, of which although I wish to look at the face of it, I have sunk into the swamp of distractions and laziness. 

Therefore, I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to swiftly grab hold of me with your compassion!



Although I do wish to, by abiding well on the profound path of the view, walk on the path to complete liberation, I an unfortunate one, am bound by the lasso of samsāra, 

therefore I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to cut the rope of attachment to samsara!



Although I have the wish to, give up the immediate peace (liberation of the *Srāvakas*) of personal needs, which is like the garden of the *Kunda*(a white flower),

and the wish to look at the magnificent *(teachings of the Buddha and commentaries of the great scholars), which is like the Padma (t*he Lotus flower) garden of the *Jina* (The Victorious One), my mind, however, is obscured by dark

ignorance. 

Therefore I implore you, O *Maňjuśrī*, to dispel my dense ignorance!



In short, O *Maňjuśrī*, in all of the lifetimes of mine and others,may we rely on the collection of the ocean of excellent sayings, and may I turn into a Wish Fulfilling jewel, which is the source of fulfillment of all that beings desire!



By the power of invoking you, O *Maňjuśrī,*may I through the ship of the two completely pure accumulations (merit and wisdom) liberate all beings from the ocean of existence, and may I become just like you, O*Maňjuśrī*!



  This Supplication to Maňjuśrī, which was composed by *Pandita Vidya Kokila was translated from the Tibetan to the English by me, Khöndung Vidyadhara Asanga Vajra.  The translation work was initiated in the v*alley of Manali, India in the early days of the month of the Saga constellation of the Fire Bird Year 2144 (2017), at the recommendation of Khenchen Sönam Gyatso, for the benefit of the doctrine and beings.  

  This translation is based on whatever understanding I gained from Khenchen Sönam Gyatsö’s teaching on the explanation of the supplication, which he taught to a small gathering of students including myself in the water snake year 2141 (2014) at Manali. 

  The translation was completed on the holy occasion of the 15thday in the month of the Saga constellation, lunar year 2144 of the Fire Bird (June 9th, 2017) at the great monastic seat of Ngör Ewam Chös gdan.



*Sarva Mangalam*! (May all be Auspicious!)
