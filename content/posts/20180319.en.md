​    我之前曾经说起过佛性，并说到为什么说众生皆有达成完全证悟的潜能。现在我想就此主题作进一步的讨论，使其更为明白易懂。



​    我们可以说有两种不同的佛性：一种是自然住佛性（性种），另一种是随增佛性（习种）。当我在说从无始以来众生皆有内在佛性的时候，我说的是第一种佛性——即自然住佛性。所以，虽然说众生皆有自然住佛性，但是只有菩萨或者那些受持菩萨戒并行持菩萨道的人，或者那些有菩提心的人，才具有随增佛性。



​    但不需要你是菩萨，也无论你是否佛教徒，我们都内具自然住佛性。举个例子，如果自然住佛性是脑袋，那么随增佛性就是你戴在头上的帽子了。自然住佛性恰如基座或者基础，而随增佛性就是你在上面所建造的部分了。



​    虽然说众生皆具佛性，但不同众生内在的佛性状况也还是有所不同，因为有些众生的佛性已经觉醒，另一些众生的佛性尚未觉醒。所谓佛性已经觉醒，就是说其内在的佛性已经做好了走向证悟的准备；所谓尚未觉醒就是虽内具佛性，但是还没有做好逐步走向最终证悟的准备。

​    有四种吉兆可以说某人佛性已经觉醒或者说已经做好了走向证悟的准备：





- 甚至在进入佛门之前，此人已具有自然而然的大悲心；



- 甚至在皈依佛门之前，此人已经自然而然具足对三宝（佛、法、僧）的信心；



- 甚至在进入修法之前，若有人加害，此人已能自然而然面对施害者修忍辱行；



- 甚至在进入修法之前，此人已经在乐行一切善行。



上面就是佛性已觉醒者的四种吉兆。

​    另一方面，也有四种过失或者障碍会阻碍一个人佛性的觉醒：



- 如果一个人在很长的时间里面，一直习于让自己的无明垢染控制自己的心行，他自然就会对外物如财富、食物等产生执念，也可能会对其他人（那些他喜爱的人）产生执念，也可能会去厌恶另外一些人（那些他不喜欢的人）。这就是阻碍一个人佛性完全觉醒的第一种障碍。

  

- 一个人如果结交恶友，并且为其所影响，那就是第二种障碍。

  

- 一个人如果原来曾拜过外道师，且此外道师不让他行持正法，那就是第三种障碍；即使此外道师也放他修行正法，但还是在继续教授他外道法或外道见，这仍旧是一种障碍。即使你有机会找到一个能够教你正法的老师并跟随他学习，你也会陷于冲突之中，因为你不想让原来的老师不开心。这种状况就是一种行持正法的障碍，能够阻碍你佛性的觉醒。

  

- 第四种障碍就是因为过于贫穷，如果一个人不具备食物、衣服等起码的生存条件，他就没有信心，也不会觉得佛道值得行持。同样，如果是因为其他人的原因，如你所爱的人、一起的人或者是国王、领导等对你有很大的影响力，那也有可能会阻碍你追随正法，这也是佛性觉醒的第四种障碍。



​    故此，无论是佛性已经觉醒的四种吉兆，还是阻碍佛性觉醒的四种障碍，都值得我们好好探究。这些因素决定了你内在佛性的状态，所以很值得关注。

​    因为那些伟大的祖师们已经写下并为我们留下了这些极有说服力的、优美的正法宝藏，我们也就没有必要再去造作什么新东西了。我自己的经验实在是没有什么新东西好说，我更愿意去重复过去那些伟大的祖师们所教，希望这些能够利益到某些人——如果不是所有人的话。

**Understanding Buddha Nature**

**
**

​    Previously, I spoke about Buddha nature and how all sentient beings have the potential to attain full enlightenment. Now I will elaborate a little more upon this subject to make it more understandable. 



​    The Buddha nature can be categorized into two different kinds: 

 One is Natural Buddha Nature and other is Progressive Buddha Nature. When I said that from beginingless time, all sentient beings have Buddha nature within, they have the first kind of Buddha nature which is the Natural Buddha Nature. Therefore, all sentient beings have the Natural Buddha Nature while only the Bodhisattvas or those who have taken the Bodhisattva vows and are practicing on the path of Bodhisattvas or have Bodhichitta have Progressive Buddha Nature. 



​    Other than Bodhisattvas, whether you are Buddhists or non-Buddhists, we all have the Natural Buddha Nature within. And so to give you an example, the Natural Buddha Nature is like the head while the Progressive Buddha Nature is like the hat which you put on top of the head. The Natural Buddha Nature is like the base or foundation and the Progressive Buddha Nature is like what you build on top of the foundation.



​    Now although all sentient beings equally have Buddha nature, there is a difference in the kind of Buddha nature within each being because in some sentient beings Buddha nature is awakened and while in others that same Buddha nature is un-awakened. 



​    Having an awakened Buddha nature, means that it is ready to progress and when I say un-awakened, there is Buddha nature within but it is not ready to progress yet towards eventually attaining enlightenment.

​    There are four signs that a person’s Buddha nature is awakened or ready to progress:



- The first sign is that before even entering the door of Dharma, a person has natural compassion. 

  

- The second sign is that even before taking refuge in the Dharma, they have this natural faith in the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha). 

  

- The third sign is that if others harm such a person even before they enter the path of Dharma, they have natural patience and forbearance towards their tormentors.

  

  

- The fourth sign is that such a person enjoys accumulating good merit even before entering the path of the Dharma. These are the four signs of a person’s Buddha nature being awakened.

​    On the other hand, there are four faults or obstacles to a person’s Buddha nature being awakened.



- The first obstacle is that having become used to letting one’s defilements control one’s mind for too long, one happens to have a natural attachment to material things like, wealth, food, attachment to sentient beings (those that one loves) and aversion to sentient beings (those that one does not love). This is the first of the obstacles that prevents one’s Buddha nature from being fully awakened.

  

- The second obstacle is that one is connected to bad company and therefore swayed by bad influences. 

  

- The third obstacle is that if one had a non- Buddhist teacher earlier and that non- Buddhist teacher prevents one from following the path of the dharma and even if the teacher allows the pursuit of dharma, if the teacher continues to teach of non–Buddhist teachings or views, that is an obstacle. Even if you have the opportunity to study with a teacher who can teach Dharma, yet you are conflicted since you do not wish to displease your previous teacher, such a situation is an obstacle in your following of the Dharma and therefore prevents the Buddha nature from being awakened. 

  

- The fourth obstacle is that because of poverty, one does not have basic facilities like food and clothing, one does not have the confidence nor feel worthy to follow the dharma. Also, because of one’s loved ones and peers as well as kings and leaders that have power over you, one can be prevented from following the path of the Dharma and that is the fourth obstacle to awakening of Buddha nature.



​    Therefore, it is good to think of these four signs that establish one’s Buddha nature as being awakened and the four signs of obstacles that prevent the awakening of the Buddha nature. These factors determine the state of the Buddha nature within you and so it is good to be aware of this.

​    To be clear, these words are not coming directly from my own experiences nor am I good at preaching or sharing the profound dharma. I am just repeating what the great masters of the past have already said. There is no need to make up anything new since the masters of the past have already written down very eloquently and beautifully and left these precious dharma treasures for us.



​    I have nothing new to say from my own experiences but rather I am repeating what the great masters have already said before my times and hope that it will be of benefit if not to all but at least to some.



​    These teachings come from Sakya Pandita’s Clarifying the Sage’s Intent which describes the stages of the Bodhisattva’s path.
