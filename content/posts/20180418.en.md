  现在我们已经明白了因何而皈依，接下来我们就必须要搞清楚我们向谁而皈依。

  我们究竟应该向谁或何者而皈依呢？

  我们皈依佛、法、僧。

按照大乘佛教的传统说法，佛有三身。

  当我们在说佛的三身时， 我们不是在说有三个不同的独立存在的佛或者说佛有三个分开来存在的身体，而是说佛陀或者诸佛有三种存在的形式。

  证悟，就是证得了佛的三身：法身（真如身）、报身（乐报身）和化身（应化身）。

  法身说的是佛的“意”。

  报身（乐报身）是指居于阿迦腻吒天（色究竟天）佛国的佛身，仅在此佛国净土中教授且仅教授大乘佛法；并且也只有第十地的菩萨才能够得闻此报身佛之教授。我们凡夫没有能力见到佛的报身，只有第十地的菩萨才能够有幸得见报身佛并听闻其讲法。报身佛都是具备完美的三十二相、八十随行好的伟大存在。他们明确的特征是五大确定：

1. 处所确定，报身佛只居住于阿迦腻吒天的佛国；

   

2. 身相确定，报身佛常具三十二相和八十随行好：

   

3. 教法确定，报身佛只教授大乘佛法；

   

4. 弟子确定，报身佛只向十地大菩萨众教授；

   

5. 时间确定，只要轮回存在，报身佛的形式就会一直存在。

  报身佛是佛的化身或化身佛能够化现的基础，化身佛则有千万化身了。完美形态的化身佛如释迦牟尼佛，能够具足所有的三十二相、八十随行好，而且我们凡夫也可现见。化身佛也可化现为国王、王后或者是普通人如教师、艺术家或工匠等等；有时候化身佛甚至可能化现为兔子等动物，或者化现为桥梁、船只等无情物。诸佛可以通过这些种种不同的化身来利益无量的众生。诸佛因应众生不同的境况而显现出种种不同的化身，目的就是为了最大程度地去利益众生。

是以我们应该皈依所有形式之诸佛。

  其次，我们皈依法。

  法也分为两种：一是载于经典之口传教法，一是证法。

  载于经典之口传教法可能由佛直接教授，也可以由菩萨们教授，也可以由师父传授给弟子。口传教法的教授方式是由讲法者口授，受法者听闻。

  证法的传承就不是通过外在的听闻，而是经由道谛和灭谛而内在地证悟。作为有情众生，我们皆为垢染所障。按照大乘佛法的教授，只有尊贵的菩萨们通过真实修证才能现证真实的无我，灭除障垢尽无余。这种对真实无我的现证就是道谛。现证了真实的无我并灭除了所有的障垢，尊贵的菩萨们就到达了无垢无染的证悟或灭谛。这种作为真修实证之成果的证悟就是灭谛。

  第三，我们皈依僧。

  按照大乘佛教的传统，僧指的是第十地的菩萨。

  所以说，我们所皈依的对象就是佛、法、僧。

  我们迫切需要皈依。譬如说，作为在此轮回牢狱中的囚犯，我们必须寻求那些有能力解救我们离开此牢狱的人的帮助。如果我们向一个没有能力帮助我们脱离此牢狱的人求助，那是毫无意义的。因为我们自己没有这个本事脱身，除了佛法僧三宝以外我们也没有其他可以求助的对象了。无论是世间的神祇还是自然神崇拜（崇拜树木、山神等）都无法让我们脱身，所以皈依他们也毫无用处。所以，认识到皈依三宝的迫切必要性非常重要。当你寻求皈依并且在口诵“我皈依佛，我皈依法，我皈依僧”之时，须要至心至诚。如果你对三宝的力量有大信心并且诚心敬意地皈依，这一信仰的力量必将不可思议。因为你的心意在控制着你的一切身口行动，所以如果你至心至诚地信仰三宝，你的一切所作所为都将会更有意义和成效。这一点极为重要，务请牢记于心。

Refuge（part II)

  So now that we have established the causes for taking refuge, we must now think of the object of refuge. 

  Who or what are we taking refuge in?  

  We take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha.

According to the Mahayana tradition, the Buddha consists of three Buddha bodies.

   When we say three Buddha bodies, it does not mean that there are three different individual Buddhas or three separate entities of the Buddha.  Rather, it is the three forms that the Buddha or all Buddhas have. 

  When we attain enlightenment, we attain the three Buddha bodies which are Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya.

  Dharmakya means the Buddha's mind.

  Sambhogakaya (enjoyment body) is the Buddha body that resides in the Buddha realm of Akanistha and gives only Mahayana teachings only in that pure realm.  The recipients of these teachings are also only Bodhisattvas of the tenth level.  We ordinary humans are not able to see the Sambhogakaya form of Buddha.  Only those Bodhisattvas residing on the tenth level are able to see and hear the Buddha in Sambhogakaya form. The Sambhogakaya form is clearly endowed with the 32 major signs and 80 minor signs of a great being.   The five certainties or the five definite features of a Sambhogakaya Buddha are:  

1) Certainty of Place; Sambhogakaya Buddha only resides in the Buddha realm of Akanistha.  

2) Certainty of Body; Sambhogakaya Buddha is always adorned with the thirty two major and 80 minor signs of a great being.  

3) Certainty of Teachings; Sambhogakaya Buddha will always teach the Mahayana doctrine. 

4) Certainty of Disciples; Sambhogakaya Buddha will always teach to a sangha of Arya Bodhisattvas of the tenth level and 

5) Certainty of Time; the Buddha in Sambhogakaya will remain for as long as samsara exists.  

  Sambhogakaya is the base for the generation of Nirmanakaya (emanation body) of the Buddha.  There are many kinds of Nirmanakaya.  The Supreme Nirmanakaya are endowed with the 32 major signs and the 80 minor signs of a great being like the Buddha Shakyamuni and they are visible to ordinary human eyes.

  Nirmanakaya can also manifest in kings, queens and even ordinary people like teachers, artists, craftsmen etc.  Sometimes Nirmanakaya can manifest even in animals like a rabbit as well as in inanimate objects like a bridge, boat etc.  So the Buddha through the Nirmanakaya form can benefit a vast number of sentient beings in these various forms.  Nirmanakaya is manifested to benefit sentient beings in whatever way that is most beneficial or helpful to them in a particular situation. 

  So we take refuge in the Buddha in all his forms.

  Second, we take refuge in the Dharma. 

  There are two kinds of Dharma:  The Dharma of oral transmission of scriptures and the Dharma of realization. 

  The Dharma of oral transmission of scriptures can be received from the Buddha, from the Bodhisattvas and from teacher to student.  The Dharma of oral transmission is spoken by the giver and heard by the receiver.

  The Dharma of Realization is not something that is heard but realized internally as the Truth of Path and the Truth of Cessation.  As sentient beings, we are obscured by defilements.  Only the Arya Bodhisattvas through their practice have the ability to realize true selflessness that is free of defilements according to the Mahayana teachings.  This realization of true selflessness is known as Truth of Path.  Based upon this realization of true selflessness and the renunciation of all defilements, the Arya Bodhisattvas attain the Truth of Cessation or realization that is free of stain and free of faults.  This realization which is the fruit of their practice is known as the Truth of Cessation.

  The third object of refuge is the Sangha.

  According to the Mahayana tradition, Sangha refers to the Bodhisattvas of the tenth level. 

  So the objects of our refuge are the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.   There is a great need for us to take refuge.  For example, if we are prisoners in this existence of Samsara, we must seek the help of someone who has the capability of freeing us from this prison.  It would be pointless to seek help from someone who does not have the capability to free us.  Since we ourselves do not have that capability, we have no one to turn to other than the three precious jewels.  Worldly deities nor worship of nature (worshipping trees, mountains etc.) can help free us and so it is of no use to seek refuge in them.  Thus it is important to realize the necessity for seeking refuge.  When you seek refuge and make verbal recitations of “I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Dharma and I take refuge in the Sangha”, do so with whole hearted sincerity.  If your mind has faith in the power of the three precious jewels and you sincerely take refuge in them, then that belief is most powerful. Your mind is in control of your verbal and physical activities and so whatever you do will be more meaningful and fruitful if your mind is whole heartedly trusting in the three jewels.  Please always keep this in mind as this is very important.
