If one thinks that the Mahayana path is difficult to follow, then shouldn't the Hinayana path be the same?. The Greater Path is not difficult to follow.

 

Why is that? It is because all sentient beings are friends on the path of practicing. How is that?  It is like this: those beings that do not have happiness are our friends on accomplishing the practice of love. Those that are going through suffering are friends on the path of helping accomplish the practice of compassion. Those beings that are poor are also our friends on the path of helping accomplish the practice of generosity. And those that harm one, are one’s friends helping one to accomplish the practice of patience.

 

Therefore just as the Buddhas are the illuminators of the path, so are sentient beings our friends on accomplishing the path to enlightenment. Therefore just like the Buddhas, sentient beings are worthy of the same respect, of offerings and prostrations. It is so just as it says in the Entry into the Bodhisattva's Way of Life," A Buddha's qualities are gained from sentient beings and the victorious ones (Buddhas) alike. So why should I not respect them In the same manner as I respect the victorious one? ". So it says. 

_Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen（Translated by H.E. Khöndung Asanga Vajra Rinpoche）
