Although the journey from our current position all the way up to the state of full enlightenment may seem like a very long and impossible trip, we must not forget that attaining the state of enlightenment is one’s destiny not just for oneself but for the benefit of all sentient beings.

 The attaining of full enlightenment has always been the very destiny that is ashared quality between all sentient beings because all beings have within them the essence of the Buddha Nature, the potential to attain Buddhahood.

Now just as a gardener would plant seeds in the garden, one must also plant the seed of Buddhahood in the garden of one’s practice. Just as the gardener waters the seeds, one must also pour the cooling water of instructions and blessings from the teacher. From there the branches of method and wisdom will spread and grow. 

Just as the gardener constantly looks after the growth of the trees, one must also be diligent and constantly look after the progress of one’s Buddha Nature. When the gardener’s tree is fully grown, it will provide shade to people and animals who are tired and also offer delicious fruits to the hungry.

Likewise, the tree of enlightenment will also grow to fruition and you can now provide the shade of happiness to all sentient beings who are suffering and you can also offer the delicious fruits of Dharma to all.

H.E. KhÖndung Asanga Vajra Rinpoche, Feb, 2018.
