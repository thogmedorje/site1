By nursing the sick and attending to them as a doctor,by dispensing medicines (to those in need), and by abandoning harmful acts to animals such as throwing rocks and beating with whips, one will be free from sicknesses. By not harboring anger and by giving ornaments(to others),

a beautiful body itself will be attained.

By not having jealousy, it is well known that as a result,

one will become greatly powerful and influential."""
