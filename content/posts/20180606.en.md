**Namo Lokeshvaraya!**



I take refuge in the Guru the source of unimaginable blessings,



Life is a wheel that endlessly turns,

and turns and turns and turns,

with only one destination,

Death as we know it.



and although we know it,

we tend to forget it,

which is a shame

as a Buddhist.



Death can be a friend or a foe,

considering how you deal with it,

It’s the cause of despair for many,

and a inspirer for practitioners.



Today is just another of those days

reminding me of the nature of life,

some may say that I’m cold by saying this

but by now we should know this to be natural.



As it is well known,

that when some Kadampa disciples surprisingly remarked “this person died today”,

The Kadampa masters would reply

“Who doesn’t die?”



You my teacher were one of the best that I had,

You had a great way of being cheerful even in uncomfortable situations,

a person holding no grudges for anybody’s mistakes,

therefore offering yourself as a friend to everyone.



May we meet again in future lives,

comrades in practice,

We remember your kindness and wisdom,

and treasure it in our hearts,

now and always.



**Om Mani Padme Hum!**
