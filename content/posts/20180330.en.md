   一切众生皆内具如来藏，但仅仅是有内在佛性还是不够的。我们还必须要切实遵循佛陀指示的道路前行，并实修佛陀所教之法。除了依教奉行和实修法教以外，没有任何捷径可以证悟。所以，我们必须要实修才行。

  修行佛法的第一步就是皈依。皈依是一切后续修行的共同基础，因此这第一步是极为重要的。那么皈依的涵义是什么呢？

  我们皈依，是因为我们有大恐惧。因为我们无法以自力来灭除这一恐惧，我们就只能依靠那些能够帮助我们灭除此内在恐惧的外在力量。这即是我们一般所说的“皈依”的涵义。

  此处我所说的恐惧，是对无始以来轮回无际之苦的恐惧。看到此轮回之苦无有终结之时，我们生起此一大恐惧。正为克服此一大恐惧，我们才皈依三宝---佛、法、僧。

  我们寻求皈依主要有三大动机因素，就是恐惧、信心和慈悲心。

  我们恐惧，我们皈依。因为我们知道世尊所说的因缘之法真实不虚。

  如果我们作不善行，果报必将会是痛苦。是故，比方说今日就是我们死期的话，尽管每个人都想往生善趣，但不幸的是，我们将会有极大的可能性堕入三恶趣（旁生、饿鬼和地狱）。因为我们相对来说所作的恶行更多，也积累了更多的恶业，那就只能去投生恶趣了。

  如果我们对自己足够诚实，好好想想我们此生至今的一切所作所为，我们所作的恶行都会超过所作的善举。无论是身、口、意三门的哪一样，我们所作的恶行都肯定多于善行。所以，如果我们现在马上就死的话，九成以上我们将会投生于三恶趣。所以我们自然就会非常恐惧，担心自己过去所有的恶行的果报现前了。

  当你有此种恐惧在心，并想着自己怎样才能克服此种恐惧之时，最好的解决办法就是皈依三宝来解除自己的恐惧。

  因有这种想法在心而皈依，这种皈依的动机即是基于恐惧。

  皈依的第二种动机是信心。因为真正认识到三宝的无欺本性，你以信心而皈依三宝。

  有四种不同的信心：清净信、欲乐信、胜解信和不退转信。

  当你能够认识到三宝的不共殊胜之处后，在自己的信仰中就能够自然感受到愉悦和清净，即是清净信。

  在清净信的基础上，你还希望自己也能拥有三宝的殊胜品质，这样自己就能够去利益众生，这即是欲乐信。

  当你认识到经书中所说的三宝威力和殊胜之处，并视之为理所当然、毫无疑义；一旦自己听到或者读到，即刻就会对三宝之殊胜生起极大信心，这即是胜解信。

  第四种信心是不退转信，就是说你的信心已经成为你自己不可分割的一部分，即使是以自己的生命为代价也绝不会放弃；这种信心已经与你自己密不可分，成为你的一个有机组成部分了。为说明此点，让我们举个例子，来自于伟大的印度班智达------阿底峡尊者。

  当阿底峡尊者来到藏区后，他有一个习惯，就是一直会问他周边的人“有什么来自印度的新鲜事吗？”有一次，他就正好问到了一个刚刚从印度回来的人。对尊者的问话，此人回答到：“也没有什么太多的新鲜事，就是最近有一个佛教俗家弟子被印度教的那帮外道捉住了，并给关进了监狱。他们给了他两个选择：要么放弃对三宝的信仰，要么被处死。即使是面临再三威胁之后，这位俗家弟子还是坚定地回答说，他不会放弃对三宝的信仰。他这样说‘即使我为了取悦您口头上说放弃信仰，但我的心里永远也不会放弃三宝’。因为那些外道实在没有办法改变他的信仰，所以最终他还是被处死了。”听了这个故事之后，阿底峡尊者极为赞叹地说“一个佛弟子正该如此啊”。这就是说，即使是以你宝贵的生命为代价，你仍然能够坚持信仰，这种信心就是不退转信了。

  皈依的第三种主要动机是慈悲心，这对大乘行者来说尤为重要。

  就一般世俗人来说，他们的皈依主要是出于前面所说的那种恐惧，有时候也会是为了欲求现世的利益如长寿、发财等。小乘行者也会出于恐惧而皈依，但主要的皈依动机还是来自对三宝的信心。大乘行者当然也会有出于恐惧和信心而皈依的可能，但主要的皈依动机还是来自于慈悲心。

  作为大乘行者，我们致力于让一切众生从轮回中得到解脱。而要实现这一目标，我们就必须要自己先证悟，首先让自己不再继续受轮回之苦。如果你自己还流转于轮回之中，你就没法去帮助别人。而自己解脱的第一步，就是皈依三宝。因为只有皈依后你才有能力去帮助其他众生，所以当你有了对所有众生的大悲心，你肯定就会去皈依佛法僧三宝。

  出于慈悲心而皈依，这是大乘传承的不共殊胜之处。

  下次，我还会继续这一主题，将着重于阐述三皈依的对境。同时，很重要的一点就是，我们还要真正明白并好好想想我们为什么要皈依，以及皈依的三大主要动机因素是什么。

**Refuge (Part I)**



  All sentient beings have the essence of the Tathagata within them but it is not sufficient to just have the essence of the Buddha nature. We have to actually follow the path of the Buddha and practice the teachings of the Buddha. Unless you follow through and practice the path of the Dharma, there is no easy path to attaining enlightenment.   So therefore, we have to practice.  The first step in the practicing of the Buddha dharma is taking refuge.  Refuge is the common foundation for all practices and so it is a very important first step. What does taking refuge mean?

  We take refuge because we have this great fear and since we are not ourselves able to eliminate this fear, we rely on someone else who has the power to remove this fear within us.  This is the general meaning of taking refuge.

  The fear I speak of, is the fear of the limitless sufferings of Samsara from beginingless time.  Seeing no end to the sufferings of Samsara, we experience this great fear.  In order to overcome this fear, we take refuge in the three precious jewels – the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha

  There are three main motivating factors that cause us to seek refuge. 

  They are fear, faith and compassion.

  We seek refuge as a result of fear because we understand the nature of cause and effect as explained by the Buddha to be true.

  If we commit negative deeds it will create resultant sufferings. Therefore, if we were to die today, although we all desire a good rebirth, there is however, a higher probability of our being born in the three lower realms (Animal Realm, Hungry Ghost Realm and the Realm of Hell) because we have committed more negative acts and accumulated more negative karma to be born in a lower birth.

  So if you honestly think about it, from our experiences in life so far, we have committed more negative actions than positive.  Whether it is mental, verbal or through physical actions, we have definitely engaged in more negative deeds than positive.  So if we were to suddenly die, there is 90 percent chance that we will be born in the lower realms and so we should naturally fear the outcome of all our misdeeds.

  When you have this kind of fear and think about how you can overcome this fear, the best solution is to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha to liberate oneself from this fear.





  With this realization, if you take refuge, this taking of refuge is based on fear as a causal factor.

  The second cause of taking refuge, is faith.  Realizing the qualities of the three precious jewels, you take refuge in them motivated by faith.  

  There are four different kinds of faith.  There is Clear Faith, Longing Faith, Confident Faith and Irreversible Faith.  

  Clear Faith is experienced when you realize the extraordinary qualities of the three precious jewels and you naturally experience joyfulness and clarity in your faith. 

  Longing Faith is experienced when based upon clear faith, you long for the perfect qualities of the three precious jewels for yourself so that you may benefit all sentient beings. This kind of faith is called Longing Faith.

  Confident Faith is experienced when you realize and have complete confidence in the powers and qualities of the three precious jewels as described in the sutras.  As soon as you hear or read about them, if you have faith with great confidence in the qualities of the three precious jewels, then you have Confident Faith.

  The fourth kind of faith is Irreversible Faith which means that your faith has become such an integral part of yourself that even at the cost of your life, you would never renounce it.  This kind of faith is inseparable from oneself and becomes an intrinsic part of you.  To illustrate this point, there is the example of Lord Atisha, the great Indian Pandita.

  While in Tibet, Lord Atisha was in the habit of asking people around him “Any news from India?” So one time, he happened to ask this question to a person who had just come from India.  In response, the person said “there is not much news but recently a Buddhist lay person was caught by some Hindu heretics and put into jail.  He was given a choice if either renouncing his faith in the three precious jewels or facing execution.  Even after repeated threats, the Buddhist lay person held firm in his reply that he would not renounce his faith in the three precious jewels.  He said “even if I were to please you by verbally renouncing my faith, in my heart I will never give up the three precious jewels”.  So he was finally executed when they could not convert his faith”.  Upon hearing this story, with great admiration, Lord Atisha said “that is how a Buddhist lay person should be”.  Even when it comes to your precious life, if you are firm in your faith then such faith is Irreversible Faith.

  The third main cause of taking refuge is compassion which is very important especially to Mahayana practitioners.

  In the worldly sense, people take refuge mainly out of fear and also at times a desire to attain short term benefits like long life, prosperity etc. The Hinayana practitioners may also take refuge due to fear but mainly out of faith.  Mahayana practitioners may take refuge as a result of fear and faith but mainly due to compassion.

  As Mahayana practitioners, we seek to liberate all sentient beings from the sufferings of Samsara.  In order to do so, we have to first overcome the sufferings of Samsara ourselves by attaining enlightenment.  If you are yourself helpless, you cannot help another. The first step towards liberating oneself, is to take refuge in the three precious jewels.  As a result of taking refuge, one is able to help other sentient beings and so with great compassion for all sentient beings, one must take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.  

  Compassion as a motivating cause in taking refuge is a special quality of the Mahayana tradition.  

  Next time, I will continue with this topic and elaborate upon the three objects of refuge.  In the meantime, it is important that we understand and think about why we take refuge and the three main causes that motivate us to take refuge.
