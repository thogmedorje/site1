**说皈依（四）皈依之功德**















皈依的功德可分为两种：

1）眼前的功德

皈依之后即刻可见的功德，就是可以保护你不受来自于人或非人的伤害，让你身体痛苦和精神创伤的程度降至最低。简言之，通过皈依，你能够去除所有不悦意的因素或境况。

有这样一种说法：即使你皈依时对于皈依的力量没有很大信心或并非全心全意，单单是诵读了皈依偈，你就会有极大利益；更不要说当你真正地、全心全意地相信皈依的力量时所带来的无穷利益了。

通过皈依，你还可以获得殊胜的品德。有两种通过皈依而得到的殊胜品德：

1. 名义上的改变：皈依了，从此之后你就可以自认是佛教徒，你就可以加入于那些被人称为“尊贵者”之中了；
2. 根本上的改变：皈依了，你就成为一个值得整个世界包括鬼神在内都会礼敬的对象。从总体上说，你得到极大的护佑；具体而言，你得到那些护法们的护佑。正如一个人在旅途的商人找到向导来护持他时一样，（通过皈依）你能够得到心灵上的安宁，你会有信心自己在未来世将永不背离三宝。

2）终极的功德：

皈依的终极功德，其中一部分为自得，另一部分当你皈依时为他人所得。

通过皈依佛，你自身会得到终极的利益，因为最终成佛的适当契机和种子于此埋下；

通过皈依法，你终将能够持续讲法说法，契机和种子于此埋下；

通过皈依僧，你终将能够统理大比丘众及大菩萨众，契机和种子于此埋下。

你皈依时他人所得的终极功德是：单单是通过你皈依而达致的上述功德，你（未来）的弟子们即可渐渐被导入佛法之途，并将最终领悟三宝的不共殊胜之处。

只是皈依即可得到如是功德，你可能会犹豫不信。对于皈依的如是甚深功德，或许你也无法轻易了知或完全体会。

说到皈依的殊胜功德，有这样一个例证。在甘珠尔（藏文的大藏经）中有一部名为“皈依经”的经书，其中说到，有一天舍利弗（释迦牟尼佛的上首弟子之一）突然想到一个问题：如果有人问我皈依的利益和功德，我应该如何回答才正确呢？为了让自己能够回答好这个问题，舍利弗就到了佛所，问道，“世尊，什么是皈依的功德？”世尊回答说：若有人诚信于法并以各式珍宝建造佛塔，此佛塔高耸入云直至色究竟天，此人会将有无量功德；但是，如果有人只是发愿皈依三宝，此功德也将过于彼。

故此，希望此例证可以帮助那些未能完全明白或清楚皈依功德的人，让他们能够稍微了解皈依三宝的利益和功德究竟有多大。

以上所说皈依的功德，是根据萨迦班智达的“圣者密意释”和其他一些大德的教言。当然，皈依可以说是初学者刚刚进入佛门时主要的修行功课，但是，重要的是要记住此修行功课不仅仅是对初学者而言，即使是对那些早就进入佛门的人也同样重要，直至完全证悟为止。

修行皈依是最最基本的，没有此项修持，成办佛道不说不可能，也将极为困难。事实上有一种说法，就是说一切的佛法修持都包括在皈依里面。

有很多不同的方法或角度来说皈依，我此处所说是按照大乘佛教中因乘的一般教法来说的。

希望大家都能够真正懂得皈依三宝的重要性，并能够从皈依中真正获得殊胜利益和功德，速得无上正等正觉！

**Refuge (Part IV)**

**-Benefits of Taking Refuge**

















To speak of the benefits of taking refuge, there are two kinds of benefits: 

1) Immediate benefits - Immediate benefits of taking refuge protects you from undesirable things like harm from humans and demons and minimizes physical pain and mental sufferings. In brief, by taking refuge, one can remove all unfavorable factors or circumstances. 

It is said that even if one does not have great or wholehearted faith in the power of refuge, just by reciting the refuge formula alone, great benefits can arise. Not to mention the tremendous benefits of taking refuge if one truly and wholeheartedly believes in the powers of taking refuge.

As a result of taking refuge, you also gain excellent qualities.  There are two types of excellent qualities resulting from the taking of refuge: 

a) Changing of name: Having taken refuge, hereafter one can consider oneself a Buddhist.  You are now included within the ranks of those who are called “very noble” 

b) Substantial change: By taking refuge you become an object worthy of worship by the whole world including the Gods. In general you gain great protection and in particular, you gain the protection of the Gods who love the doctrine.  Like a traveling merchant who has found a guide to escort him, you can gain peace of mind and you gain confidence that you will never be parted from the three jewels in all future lives.

2) Ultimate benefits: Some of the ultimate benefits of taking refuge are reaped by oneself and some benefits are reaped by others as a result of your taking refuge.  By taking refuge in the Buddha, you yourself, will ultimately benefit because the correct conditions are thereby established for your attainment of Buddhahood.  By taking refuge in the Dharma, the conditions are set ultimately for you to teach the Dharma continually.  And by taking refuge in the Sangha, you establish the correct conditions for you to ultimately gather together a vast retinue consisting of the order of fully ordained monastics and the order of Bodhisattvas.  The benefits that occur to others are that purely by virtue of your own accomplishments of those things, your disciples will gradually be introduced into the doctrine of the Buddha and ultimately achieve direct realization of the three jewels.

You may not be able to immediately appreciate these benefits just by taking refuge.  You may not be able to easily understand or fully appreciate the depths of the benefits of taking refuge.  

To give you an example of the great benefits of taking refuge, in the Kangyur (a collection of the Buddha's teachings translated in the Tibetan language) there is a sutra known as the “Refuge Sutra” and in there, it says that one day Shariputra (one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha Shakyamuni) thought to himself that if someone were to ask him about the benefits of taking refuge, how could he correctly answer such a question?  To prepare himself to answer such a question, Shariputra approached the Buddha and asked the Buddha “What are the benefits of taking refuge?”  The Buddha replied that if there was a person who was very faithful to the Dharma and if that person created a stupa solely made out of precious jewels and this great stupa were to reach up to the heavenly realm known as Akanishtha, such a person would be generating vast merit by building this hypothetical stupa.  But, said the Buddha, even more meritorious than such an accomplishment, are the merits of taking refuge in the three jewels.  

So therefore, hopefully by this example those who are not able to fully understand the benefits or appreciate them will get a glimpse of how beneficial it is to take refuge in the three jewels.

I have explained a little about the benefits of taking refuge based upon Sakya Pandita’s “Clarifying the Sage’s Intent” and also some other teachings by Buddhist scholars.  

Of course taking refuge is the main Buddhist practice for beginners when one starts entering the Buddha’s path but the important thing to remember is that it is not just for beginners but also for those who are already set on the path of the Buddha and until one attains enlightenment.  

The practice of taking refuge is most essential.  Without it, attaining full enlightenment would be difficult if not impossible.  Actually it is said that all Buddhist practices are included within the refuge.  

There are many ways of speaking about refuge but what I have presented here is that according to the general Causal Vehicle of the Mahayana path.  I hope that you will understand the importance of taking refuge in the three jewels and that you will receive immense benefits from the practice and swiftly attain full enlightenment.
