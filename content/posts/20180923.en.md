 Abandoning the thought of Awakening the Bodhicitta Mind due to Discouragement





​    退失或不愿发起愿菩提心的第二个原因是：

  遇到挫折而灰心气馁。

  在当今社会，所有人都在追求即刻的效用和激励，故此人们很容易因无法得到即刻的效用而放弃，这种情况比比皆是。那些已经走在解脱道上的人，也有可能因为他们对自己的修行结果没有信心，从而退失了愿菩提心。

  根据萨迦班智达在《牟尼密意显明论》中的教言，那些因未能得到即刻效用就沮丧灰心从而放弃修持善法的人实在是很愚痴。例如：可能虽然修持了布施，自己的财富还是在减少；可能严格持戒，自己的身体还是不好；或者为了病人康复而供养修持了各种仪轨，但是病人非但没有康复，反而死去了。诸如此类现象有可能会让一些人失去对三宝力量的信心，灰心气馁而放弃正法之路。

  这种灰心气馁的对治方法就是努力发起修行正法的真实意乐。正如寂天菩萨在《入菩萨行论》中所说：

故应除疲厌，驭驾觉心驹，

从乐趋胜乐，智者宁退怯？

  下面所节录的萨迦班智达《牟尼密意显明论》中的教言，为我们清楚指明了在何种情况下我们众生会死亡，我们如何做可以延缓死亡，以及最终做到接受死亡而不丧失对三宝的信仰。

  “此外，总体上来说，在七种情况下死亡可能发生：1、寿尽；2、业尽；3、福德尽；4、寿尽并业尽；5、寿尽并福德尽；6、业尽并福德尽；7、三者皆尽。

  就寿尽的情形来说，修持尊胜佛母（主长寿之佛母）等成就法以求延寿、或接受长寿灌顶之类的做法是有帮助的。

  就业尽的情形来说，将那些行将就戮的动物放生会有帮助。

  而对于福德尽，可以用如下的方法来改变违缘以重获福德：

  向自己的佛法导师作虔诚的供养；

  禳解于三宝之前，诵经或供养、承侍僧团以累积福德，施食子给鬼神；

  放弃所有的财产作为对贪执的出离；

  服食药物对治疾病；

  修持寂止以对治心性的掉举、狂乱；

  再就是念诵那些祈请以三宝加持力普利有情之咒语，祈请顺缘增上、吉祥圆满。

  就那三种具有两项致死因素的情形而言，如果是寿尽并业尽，那就必须同时采用上面所说的这两项致死因素的对治方法；如果是寿尽并福德尽，那就针对这两项作对治；业尽并福德尽同样也是如此。

  以上述方法进行对治之后，就上述三种只有一项致死因素的情形而言，消灾延寿应该可以做到了；如果是上述具有两项因素的情形，那么竭尽心力去做对治的话也许还可以消灾延寿；但是如果上述致死的因素三项俱全的话，那就真是无计可施了。正如火塘余烬里的一缕余烟，或水源已干的小水塘，这种情形就是诸佛亲临也无法逆转了。

  故此，对那些用尽上述禳解方法仍然不免一死的人来说，就是寿、业、福德这三项维系生命的资粮都已经完全耗尽了。

  所以，我们不能说那些禳解方法没有用，也不能因此而对之失去信心。

  因为病人死在床上了，就说这床真没用，然后就把床丢了，这事合适吗？或者说是房子、吃的喝的、药物等等都不要了，就因为病人死在这个房子里或者是因为病人吃了喝了这些东西、服用了这个药物？

  同样的道理，死亡的来临是因为存活的因缘之力耗尽了，而不是禳解的方法和善法不管用。

  更进一步说，过去的业力会以三种方式存在：此生感果；来世感果；再后世或多世后才感果。

  无论是善行还是恶业，若是要在此生感果的话，那就必须要满足以下几个条件：特殊的受者（父母诸尊重等恩造之所）、意乐、所作事。正如教言中所说：

  正因受者身份特殊及作业之意乐强烈，

  这些行为的后果在可见（现在）的世界马上就会成熟现前。

  如果你做了一件很不寻常的善业或者恶业，事件本身重大、作业的善或恶的意乐也很强，且对境是父母诸尊重等恩造之所，那么你所造作的业在此生就会成熟感果，即是所谓”现世可见之业果“。不过，能够造作这种善业或者恶业的人是极为少见的。如果人们造作的业没有那么重的话，这些行为的后果将会在下一世成熟，下一世受生后才会感果。更轻一些的业则会在再后世甚至是再后面才会成熟感果。

  因此，如果一个人无恶不作却享尽福乐，或者一个人一直躬行善举却受尽苦难，这其实是他们在收获自己前世或再前世所作之业的果实。正因为如此，我们才要特别小心取舍善恶因果。”

  深入思考萨迦班智达的这些智慧教言，对我们理解因果的本质极为重要，也非常有益于增强我们修行正法的信心，即使遇到挫折和障碍也不会退失。

  这样的话，我们就不会因挫折而退失愿菩提心。

Abandoning the thought of Awakening the Bodhicitta Mind due to Discouragement



  The second cause of abandoning the thought of awakening or generating Bodhicitta mind is:

  Abandoning the thought of awakening due to discouragement.

  In today’s society where everyone desires and demands instant gratification, it is very common for people to feel easily discouraged upon not getting the desired result right away. Those on the path to seek liberation may abandon the thought of awakening the Bodhicitta mind because they are discouraged by their loss of faith in the outcome of their practice.

  According to Sakya Pandita’s Clarifying the Sage’s Intent, those that are foolish become dejected and cease to practice virtuous deeds because they did not instantly receive the fruits of their efforts. For example, although they practiced generosity, their wealth decreased; although they practiced strict moral discipline, their physical body weakened or they performed pujas and rituals for the recovery of a sick person and instead of recovering, the patient dies. Such occurrences would discourage some people from believing in the powers of the Three Precious Jewels and they may give up the path of dharma.

  The remedy to prevent such demoralized thoughts is to generate enthusiastic joy for practicing the dharma. For as it is said in the Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life:

  “Mounted on the horse of thought of awakening

  (that dispels all discouragement and fatigue)

  And going to greater and greater happiness,

What wise person would become discouraged?”









![img](data:image/gif;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVQImWNgYGBgAAAABQABh6FO1AAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)





 

  The following excerpts from Sakya Pandita’s Clarifying the Sage’s Intent, give a clear understanding of the circumstances under which we experience death and what we can do to prevent as well as accept the occurrence of death without losing faith.

  “Moreover in general, seven circumstances exist in which death will occur:1) when the life force is exhausted, 2) when the force of previous deeds is exhausted, 3) when the force of merit is exhausted, 4) the exhaustion of both life force and force of previous deeds, 5) the exhaustion of both life force and force of merit, 6) the exhaustion of both force of previous deeds and the force of merit and 7) the exhaustion of all three.

  For the exhaustion of life force, such things as performing the Ushnishavijaya (goddess of long life) ritual for prolonging longevity, receiving long life initiations etc. will help. For the exhaustion of the power of past deeds, it is helpful to perform life release of animals that otherwise would be slaughtered.     When merit has been exhausted, there is the restoration of merit by repelling unfavorable circumstances through such means as making worshipful offerings to the religious preceptor; practicing the propitiative rites to the Three Jewels, reciting the sacred scriptures and acquiring merit through offerings and service to the Sangha, offering sacrificial cakes to the spirits; renouncing all material possessions as an antidote to attachment; taking medicines as an antidote to disease; practicing meditative concentration as an antidote to mental instability and reciting the universally beneficial invocations of the sustaining power of the Three Jewels and the auspicious coming together of circumstances.

  For the three instances where two elements coincide, if it is the life force and past deeds whose force is exhausted, you should revive those two. If it is the life force and merit, then revive those. And if it is the force of deeds and merit that are becoming exhausted, those should be restored.

  By doing as described above, you can restore life in the three cases where only one element is exhausted. If two are exhausted in combination, through great effort they can be revived. But if someone is dying as a result of the exhaustion of all three forces, there is no means to restore that person to further life. Like the smoke of an extinguished fire or the pool of stream whose headwaters have dried up, even the Lord Buddha himself cannot avert it. Therefore death that occurs despite the performance of all the propitiative methods is a sign that all three causes sustaining life have become exhausted.

  Thus it is wrong to say that propitiative religious practices do not work and thereby give up faith in them. How could you rightly discard such things as beds, saying they do not work because the patient died on a bed? Or give up houses, food, drink and medicines, saying that these are not effective because the patient died in a house, or after eating, drinking, or taking medicine? Similarly, when death occurs, it is that the forces that propel life have become exhausted and not that propitiative religious practices and roots of virtue are ineffective.

  Furthermore, three kinds of former actions exist: those whose results are experienced in the present lifetime, those whose results will be experienced after the next birth, and those whose results are experienced at another, even later time. Whether an action is virtuous or non-virtuous, for its result to be experienced in the present life, an exceptional recipient, motivating thought, and object must be involved. As it is taught:

  Because of a particularly (special) recipient and motivating thought,

  There are acts whose fruits are experienced in the (present) visible world.

  If you commit an exceptional act of virtue or non-virtue involving an especially excellent object, through an extremely good or evil motivation, and toward an exceptional recipient, then that action will give rise to a result in this very life, which is called “the result visible in the present lifetime”. People who commit such acts of virtue or non-virtue are extremely rare. If a person commits a slightly weaker deed, that act will give rise to a result in the next life, a result to be experienced after the next birth. An act of still smaller strength is a deed whose result will be experienced at another, even later time.

  Therefore, if a person who only commits evil deeds seems to experience inappropriate happiness, or if a person who only commits virtuous acts seems to experience inappropriate sufferings, that is a sign of their reaping the results of acts that ripen in the next life or even later, and for this reason you should be very careful about moral cause and effect.”

  Reflecting upon these words of wisdom from Sakya Pandita, is crucial in understanding the nature of cause and effect and thereby beneficial in strengthening our resolve to practice the dharma despite setbacks and obstacles. Abandoning the thought of awakening due to discouragement can thus be defeated.
