In the afternoon of August 31st, His Eminence Khöndhung Asanga Vajra Rinpoche bestowed the Vajrapani Butadamara initiation to the monastic sangha including monks from the Kalimpong Sakya Monastery, Sakya Rimbick College, Kurseong Sakya Monastery and the Guru Sakya Monastery.   Prior to the Vajrapani initiation, Rinpoche also gave the oral transmission and commentary on Ghang- blo- ma, prayer in praise of Manjushri, the Buddha of wisdom. As students of Buddhist ritual and scripture, Rinpoche encouraged the monks to engage in study and contemplation. Rinpoche also spoke about the benefits of both the ritual practice as well as learning of the scriptures of Tibetan Buddhism and that students should strive to respect and excel in both practices.

Vajrakilaya puja and practice is a powerful practice for removing all obstacles. The annual Grand Vajrakilaya puja at the Guru Sakya Monastery is considered even more precious and powerful as this is the oldest Sakya monastery outside of Tibet.

In 1960, a small retinue of monks led by His Holiness the 41st Sakya Ghongma Trichen Rinpoche performed the first grand Vajrakilaya puja outside of Tibet here at the Guru Sakya Monastery. Then in 1961, the entire monastic sangha of Guru Sakya Monastery jointly performed the grand Vajrakilaya puja and since that time it has become an annual tradition that continues to the present time without any disruptions.
